# Lyrics Availability Indicator

This document explains the lyrics availability indicator feature that helps users identify which songs have karaoke lyrics available.

## Overview

The lyrics indicator is a visual badge that appears next to song titles throughout the application, showing whether a song has karaoke lyrics available or is audio-only.

## Visual Design

### Badge Variants

The indicator comes in two states:

#### âœ… **Karaoke Available** (Green Badge)
- **Color**: Green background with dark green text
- **Icon**: Microphone/speaker icon
- **Text**: "Karaoke"
- **Tooltip**: "Lyrics available"

#### ðŸŽµ **Audio Only** (Gray Badge)
- **Color**: Gray background with gray text  
- **Icon**: Speaker with X icon
- **Text**: "Audio Only"
- **Tooltip**: "No lyrics available"

### Size Options

The indicator supports three sizes:
- **Small (`sm`)**: Used in mobile lists and compact displays
- **Medium (`md`)**: Used in TV queue displays
- **Large (`lg`)**: Used in prominent displays like next song splash

## Implementation

### Component Structure

```typescript
<LyricsIndicator 
  song={mediaItem} 
  size="sm" 
  variant="badge" 
/>
```

### Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `song` | `MediaItem` | Required | The song object to check for lyrics |
| `size` | `"sm" \| "md" \| "lg"` | `"sm"` | Size of the indicator |
| `variant` | `"badge" \| "icon" \| "text"` | `"badge"` | Display style |
| `className` | `string` | `""` | Additional CSS classes |

### Logic

The indicator checks for the presence of `song.lyricsPath`:
```typescript
const hasLyrics = Boolean(song.lyricsPath);
```

## Locations

The lyrics indicator appears in the following locations:

### ðŸ“± Mobile Interface

## Technical Details

### Data Source

The indicator relies on the `lyricsPath` field in the `MediaItem` type:

```typescript
interface MediaItem {
  // ... other fields
  lyricsPath?: string; // Optional path to lyrics file
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for consistent styling:

```css
/* Karaoke Available */
.karaoke-available {
  @apply bg-green-100 text-green-800 border border-green-200;
}

/* Audio Only */
.audio-only {
  @apply bg-gray-100 text-gray-600 border border-gray-200;
}
```

### Icons

Uses inline SVG icons for optimal performance:
- **Karaoke**: Microphone/speaker icon
- **Audio Only**: Speaker with X overlay icon

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Lyrics Quality Indicator**
   - Show different badges for different lyrics sources
   - Indicate synchronized vs static lyrics

2. **Language Support**
   - Show language flags for multi-language lyrics
   - Indicate original vs translated lyrics

3. **User Preferences**
