3. **Smooth Transitions** - Seamless flow between different display states

## Technical Implementation

### New Components

1. **RatingAnimation** (`/components/tv/RatingAnimation.tsx`)
   - Spinning wheel animation
   - Grade reveal with colors and effects
   - Celebration animations for high grades

2. **NextSongSplash** (`/components/tv/NextSongSplash.tsx`)
   - Song information display
   - Countdown timer
   - Animated background elements

3. **ApplausePlayer** (`/components/tv/ApplausePlayer.tsx`)
   - Audio playback for applause sounds
   - Fallback synthetic audio generation
   - Volume control

### New Utilities

1. **Rating Generator** (`/lib/ratingGenerator.ts`)
   - Weighted random grade generation
   - Score calculation within grade ranges
   - Contextual messages for each grade
   - Bonus system for longer songs

### Updated Types

- Added `TVDisplayState` enum for different display modes
- Added `SongRating` interface for rating data
- Added `TransitionState` interface for managing transitions

## Configuration

### Applause Sounds

Place applause sound files in `/public/sounds/`:
- `applause-1.mp3` - General applause
- `applause-2.mp3` - Enthusiastic applause
- `applause-3.mp3` - Crowd cheering
- `applause-crowd.mp3` - Large crowd applause

### Rating System

The rating system uses weighted probabilities:
- A+ (5% chance) - Perfect performance
- A (15% chance) - Excellent
- A- (20% chance) - Very good
- B+ (25% chance) - Good (most common)
- B (20% chance) - Above average
- B- (10% chance) - Average
- C+ and below (5% total) - Below average

### Timing Customization

You can adjust timing in the component props:
```tsx
<RatingAnimation duration={4000} /> // 4 seconds
<NextSongSplash duration={3000} />  // 3 seconds
```

## Usage

The transitions are automatically handled by the TV display. When a song ends:

1. The system detects song completion
2. Generates a random rating for the performance
3. Shows applause animation with rating
4. If there's a next song, shows the splash screen
5. Automatically starts the next song
6. If no next song, returns to waiting screen

## Development

### Testing Transitions

You can test transitions by:
1. Adding songs to the queue
2. Playing a song and letting it complete naturally
3. Or using keyboard shortcuts to skip through transitions

### Adding New Rating Messages

Edit `/lib/ratingGenerator.ts` to add new messages:
```typescript
const gradeMessages = {
  'A+': [
    'Absolutely phenomenal!',
    'Your new message here!',
    // ...
  ]
};
```

### Customizing Animations

The components use Tailwind CSS classes for animations. You can modify:
- Spin duration: `animate-spin`
- Fade effects: `transition-opacity duration-300`
- Scale effects: `transform scale-110`
- Color schemes: Grade-based color functions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- User-customizable rating messages
- Different rating systems (stars, numbers, etc.)
- Sound effect variations based on grade
- Audience participation features
- Performance statistics tracking
- Custom transition themes
